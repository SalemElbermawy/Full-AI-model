AI & Data Interactive Platform
==============================

Project Overview
----------------
This project is an all-in-one interactive platform for AI, machine learning, computer vision, and data analysis. It includes tools for:

1. Regression Models: Train and predict using Linear Regression, ElasticNet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVR, KNN, and Decision Trees.
2. Object Detection: Detect and classify objects in images using YOLOv8 with bounding boxes and labels.
3. OCR Text Extraction: Extract and organize text from images with EasyOCR, supporting multi-language recognition.
4. Train Your Model App: Upload datasets, preprocess, train regression or classification models, and visualize metrics.
5. Notes Module: Add, view, and manage personal notes within the app.

Features
--------
- Upload CSV datasets or images for analysis
- Interactive data previews and visualizations
- Input custom values for model predictions
- Dark and light mode compatible design
- Modern UI with emojis, info boxes, and success alerts
- Real-time model training with progress indicators

How to Use
----------
1. Run the Streamlit app.
2. Navigate through the pages: Regression, Object Detection, OCR, Notes, Train Your Model.
3. Upload your data or images as required.
4. Select target columns, models, or options.
5. Enter inputs and view predictions, extracted text, or visualizations.
6. Manage notes in the Notes page.
